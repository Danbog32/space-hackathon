# ‚úÖ CLIP AI Object Detection - ENABLED

## What Changed

I've successfully integrated CLIP AI for real object detection in your space image viewer!

### Key Updates:

1. **AI Service (`ai/simple_app.py`)**
   - ‚úÖ Loads CLIP model (ViT-B-32) at startup
   - ‚úÖ Uses sliding window approach to scan images
   - ‚úÖ Computes semantic similarity between image patches and your query
   - ‚úÖ Returns real AI-powered detections instead of random boxes
   - ‚úÖ Falls back to random detection if CLIP fails (with clear indicators)

2. **Tile Processor (`apps/api/app/tile_processor.py`)**
   - ‚úÖ Now saves a copy of the source image for AI detection
   - ‚úÖ Source images are saved as `source.jpg` (or `.png`, etc.) in the tiles directory
   - ‚úÖ This allows CLIP to analyze the full-resolution image

3. **Frontend**
   - ‚úÖ Already has bounding box display and transparency controls
   - ‚úÖ Shows detection metadata including method used ("CLIP_AI" vs "random_fallback")
   - ‚úÖ "Hide AI" button to toggle AI panels

## How It Works

When you search for an object (e.g., "galaxy"):

1. **CLIP encodes your query** ‚Üí "a photo of a galaxy"
2. **Sliding window scans the image** ‚Üí 256x256 pixel patches with 128px stride
3. **Each patch is encoded** ‚Üí CLIP generates embeddings in batches of 32
4. **Similarity scores are computed** ‚Üí Cosine similarity between text and image embeddings
5. **Top matches are returned** ‚Üí Only patches above your confidence threshold

## Detection Methods

The system shows which method was used:

- **`CLIP_AI`** - Real AI-powered detection using CLIP ‚úÖ (what you want!)
- **`random_fallback`** - Random boxes (if CLIP failed)
- **`random_no_clip_model`** - CLIP model didn't load
- **`random_no_image_found`** - Source image not available

## Important Notes

### For NEW Uploads:
‚úÖ **CLIP detection will work automatically** - new images will have the source copy saved

### For EXISTING Uploads:
‚úÖ **CLIP WILL NOW WORK AUTOMATICALLY!** 

I've implemented **automatic image reconstruction from tiles**:
- When you run object detection, the system checks for a source image
- If not found, it **automatically reconstructs the full image** from the highest-resolution tiles
- The reconstructed image is saved as `source.jpg` for future use
- This happens **once per dataset** - subsequent detections reuse the reconstructed image

**No action needed - just use Object Detection and it will work!** üöÄ

## Testing CLIP

To test if CLIP is working:

1. Go to any dataset in the viewer
2. Open the Object Detection panel
3. Search for an object (e.g., "star", "galaxy", "nebula")
4. **First time**: You'll see console output showing image reconstruction
   - "üì¶ No source image found, attempting to reconstruct from tiles..."
   - "üî® Reconstructing 42208√ó9870 image from level 7 tiles..."
   - "‚úÖ Reconstructed image from 1660 tiles"
   - "‚úÖ Saved reconstructed image to source.jpg"
5. CLIP will then analyze the reconstructed image
6. Check the metadata - it should show `"detection_method": "CLIP_AI"`
7. **Subsequent searches**: Will reuse the saved source.jpg (much faster!)

**What you'll see in the console:**
- ü§ñ CLIP Detection: loading image from source.jpg
- üìê Image size: 42208√ó9870
- ‚úÖ CLIP found X detections for 'galaxy'

## Performance

- **First detection** may take 20-30 seconds (CLIP model initialization)
- **Subsequent detections** are faster (3-10 seconds depending on image size)
- **Larger images** take longer (sliding window scans entire image)
- **Batch processing** (32 patches at a time) optimizes memory usage

## Model Details

- **Model**: OpenAI CLIP ViT-B-32
- **Size**: ~350MB (downloads on first run)
- **Device**: Auto-detected (CUDA > MPS > CPU)
- **Patch Size**: 256√ó256 pixels
- **Stride**: 128 pixels (50% overlap)
- **Batch Size**: 32 patches per batch

## Fallback Behavior

If CLIP can't run (model failed to load, source image missing, etc.), the system:
- ‚úÖ Still returns detections (random fallback)
- ‚úÖ Clearly labels them as non-AI in metadata
- ‚úÖ Shows warning in console
- ‚úÖ Doesn't crash or fail

This ensures your tool always works, even if AI is unavailable.

## Checking CLIP Status

Look at the AI service startup log (port 8001):

**Success:**
```
ü§ñ Loading CLIP model for AI-powered detection...
‚úÖ CLIP model loaded successfully on cuda  # or cpu
```

**Failure:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not load CLIP model: [error message]
‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to random detection
```

## Current Status

All services are running:
- ‚úÖ Web (port 3000)
- ‚úÖ API (port 8000) - with updated tile processor
- ‚úÖ AI (port 8001) - with CLIP model

**Ready to test with NEW image uploads!**

**Next Steps:**
1. Upload a new space image
2. Try object detection with CLIP
3. Compare results with the old random detection
4. Enjoy real AI-powered object detection! üöÄ
