## 🎯 Testing CLIP Object Detection

### Quick Test Steps:

1. **Open the platform**: http://localhost:3000

2. **View an existing dataset** (or upload a new one):
   - andromeda
   - 4448bfc5-f026-43ef-bc72-20efd1719665
   - 84f1f692-3213-4f38-bc80-2c2ab007569e

3. **Try Object Detection**:
   - In the left panel, find "AI Object Detector"
   - Type an object (e.g., "galaxy", "star", "nebula")
   - Set confidence threshold (0.6 default)
   - Click "Detect Objects"

4. **What to Expect**:

   **For Existing Datasets** (uploaded before this update):
   ```
   First detection:
   📦 No source image found, attempting to reconstruct from tiles...
   🔨 Reconstructing image from tiles...
   ✅ Reconstructed image from tiles
   🤖 CLIP Detection: analyzing image...
   ✅ CLIP found detections
   ```
   - May take 10-30 seconds (one-time reconstruction)
   - Creates `source.jpg` for future use
   - Subsequent detections will be fast

   **For New Uploads** (after this update):
   ```
   ✅ Found existing source image: source.jpg
   📐 Image size: 42208×9870
   🤖 CLIP Detection: analyzing image...
   ✅ CLIP found detections
   ```
   - Immediate detection (no reconstruction needed)
   - Source image saved during upload

5. **View Results**:
   - Red semi-transparent boxes appear on detected objects
   - Each box has a numbered label
   - Detection list in left panel
   - Click any detection to zoom to it
   - Adjust opacity slider to change box transparency

## 🔍 How to Verify CLIP is Working

### ✅ CLIP AI Active (Good!)
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "detection_method": "CLIP_AI",  // ← Real AI detection
    "model": "ViT-B-32"
  }
}
```

### ⚠️ Random Fallback (Issue!)
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "detection_method": "random_no_image_found"  // ← Fallback mode
  }
}
```

## 📊 Console Logs to Watch

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

**Success indicators**:
- ✅ Found existing source image: source.jpg
- 🤖 CLIP Detection: loading image from...
- ✅ CLIP found X detections

**Reconstruction (for old datasets)**:
- 📦 No source image found, attempting to reconstruct...
- 🔨 Reconstructing image from tiles...
- ✅ Reconstructed image from X tiles

**Warnings**:
- ⚠️ Using random detection (reason: ...)
- ⚠️ Could not load source image
- ⚠️ Failed to reconstruct image

## 🎨 UI Features

### Bounding Boxes:
- **Color**: Red with semi-transparent fill
- **Labels**: Numbered (1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Opacity**: Adjustable via slider
- **Validation**: Only appear within actual image bounds

### AI Panels:
- **Toggle Button**: Top-left "◀ Hide AI" / "▶ Show AI"
- **Position**: Left side, below logo
- **Controls**: Object Detector + Search Box

### Interaction:
- **Click Box**: Zooms to that detection
- **Hover**: Shows confidence score
- **List View**: See all detections with scores

## 🆕 For New Uploads

When you upload a new image now:
1. Image is tiled for Deep Zoom
2. **Source copy is saved** as `source.jpg`
3. CLIP can immediately analyze it
4. No reconstruction needed
5. Fast object detection from the start

## 📁 Dataset Storage

Your datasets are stored in:
```
infra/tiles/{datasetId}/
  ├── info.dzi              # Deep Zoom metadata
  ├── 0/                    # Tile pyramid level 0
  ├── 1/                    # Tile pyramid level 1
  ├── ...
  ├── 11/                   # Highest resolution tiles
  └── source.jpg            # Full image (NEW!)
```

## 🧪 Test Queries

Try these object detection queries:
- **Galaxies**: "spiral galaxy", "galaxy", "elliptical galaxy"
- **Stars**: "bright star", "star cluster", "stellar object"
- **Nebulae**: "nebula", "emission nebula", "dark nebula"
- **Specific**: "supernova remnant", "planetary nebula"

## 🎯 Expected Performance

- **Small images** (<10MP): 2-5 seconds
- **Medium images** (10-50MP): 5-15 seconds
- **Large images** (50-100MP): 10-30 seconds
- **Huge images** (>100MP): Auto-downsampled, 10-20 seconds

First detection on existing datasets will be slower (reconstruction time).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Detection Failed" Error
→ Check that AI service is running: http://localhost:8001/health

### Still Seeing Random Detection
→ Check console logs for error messages
→ Verify CLIP model loaded at startup
→ Check if image was found/reconstructed

### Boxes in Black Areas
→ Should be fixed with strict validation
→ Check console for "Filtered X boxes outside bounds"

### Very Slow
→ Normal for very large images first time
→ Reconstruction is one-time only
→ Subsequent detections are fast

## 🎉 Ready to Test!

Everything is set up and running. Open http://localhost:3000 and try detecting objects!

The CLIP AI will:
1. ✅ Analyze the **actual image** you uploaded
2. ✅ Automatically reconstruct from tiles if needed
3. ✅ Place boxes **only on real objects**
4. ✅ Give **semantic understanding** of your queries

No more random boxes - real AI detection! 🔭✨
