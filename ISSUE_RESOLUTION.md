# Issue Resolution: "Failed to fetch datasets"

## Problem

The web application was showing the error:

```
Error loading datasets
Failed to fetch datasets
```

## Root Cause

The FastAPI backend server was not running on port 8000. The Next.js web application tries to fetch datasets from `http://localhost:8000/datasets`, but the API server wasn't started.

## Solution

Started the API server:

```bash
cd apps/api
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Verification

After starting the API server, all endpoints are now working correctly:

### 1. Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T16:26:50.812008"
}
```

### 2. Datasets Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/datasets
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "andromeda",
    "name": "Andromeda Galaxy (NASA Hubble 2025)",
    "description": "High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope mosaic of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). 42208x9870 pixels of stunning detail...",
    "tileType": "dzi",
    "tileUrl": "/tiles/andromeda",
    "pixelSize": [42208, 9870],
    "metadata": {
      "telescope": "Hubble Space Telescope",
      "date": "2025-01-01",
      "is_real_data": true
    }
  }
]
```

### 3. Tiles Available

- DZI metadata: ✅ http://localhost:8000/tiles/andromeda/info.dzi
- Base tile: ✅ http://localhost:8000/tiles/andromeda/0/0_0.jpg
- Real dimensions: 42208 x 9870 pixels

## Current Status

✅ **API Server:** Running on port 8000  
✅ **Database:** Seeded with real NASA Andromeda dataset  
✅ **Tiles:** Real tiles available (42208x9870)  
✅ **Web App:** Should now display datasets correctly

## What to Do Now

1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:3000
2. You should now see **"Andromeda Galaxy (NASA Hubble 2025)"**
3. Click to open the viewer and explore the real NASA image!

## How to Start Services in Future

### Recommended: Start All Services

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts all three services (web, api, ai) simultaneously.

### Manual Start

If you need more control:

**Terminal 1 - API Server:**

```bash
cd apps/api
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Web App:**

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

**Terminal 3 - AI Service (optional):**

```bash
cd apps/ai
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

## Quick Status Check

Run this command anytime to check service status:

```bash
# Check if services are running
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health && echo "✅ API Running" || echo "❌ API Not Running"
curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null && echo "✅ Web Running" || echo "❌ Web Not Running"
```

## Documentation Created

- **[START_SERVICES.md](START_SERVICES.md)** - Complete guide for starting and troubleshooting services
- **[TILE_GENERATION.md](infra/TILE_GENERATION.md)** - Guide for processing real NASA images
- **[DATASET_UPGRADE.md](DATASET_UPGRADE.md)** - Documentation on mock vs real datasets

## Notes

- The API server automatically creates and seeds the database on startup
- The database is located at `data/astro.db`
- Tiles are served from `infra/tiles/andromeda/`
- The system auto-detects if real or mock tiles are present
- Real tiles were already generated (42208x9870 dimensions detected)

## Issue: Resolved ✅

The application should now work correctly. Refresh your browser to see the datasets!
